# An-EKG-Instrumentation-Amplifier-Design-Employing-Common-Mode-Feedback

This my project when I had course at UCSD
Oct 2020 - Dec 2020

The report is named as <An instrumentation amplifier design using common-mode feedback>
  
● Build and simulate the amplifier with driven-right-leg feedback to reduce the effects of common-mode noise; measure performance includes gain, CMRR, and mismatch with ideal op-amp models in Cadence (0.18μm CMOS Process).

● Design an amplifier with 39.7 dB Av, dm, 123 dB CMRR at 60 Hz, 2.98 uV integrated input-referred noise, and 2.7 uW power consumption that satisfies high differential mode gain/CMRR/input impedance and low noise/power
